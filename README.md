# CSCI 2461 Computer Networking 2 - Linux 
**Lou Vang**

This Linux's class had taught me so much. Now I be able to write scripts, build my own project(NetBoot), know how the network and internet work, and much more. Without this class, I won't be able to accamplished this. The most important tool I leanred was knowing how to used Github. This tool will help me a lot in the furture when I finish with school. This will bring me to where I wanted to be. I left with this class with a lot knowledge of Linux. I really appreciate for everything, thank you!
