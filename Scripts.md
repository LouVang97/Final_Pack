# Welcome to the Weekly Scripts!

**Introduction**

This Linux's class had taught me so much. Now I be able to write a script, build my own project(NetBoot), know how the network and internet work, and much more. Without this class, I won't be able to accamplished this. The following below are my weelky scripts. 

**Weely Scripts**

* **Week 1** - This week there was no script to submitted because it was the first week of the semester. This week where we introducted ourselves to each other, talked about course schedule, and a little background about Linux.

* **[Week 2](https://github.com/LouVang97/Week2/blob/master/Script2.sh)** - How Linux work, chapter 2 I learned the basic shell commands, directories, files, environment variables, special characters, and intermediate. In my script, I combine each of the cammands from those to wrote it. However, this is my first script and it wasn't good. I still working on it.

* **[Week 3](https://github.com/LouVang97/jubilant-potato/blob/master/Ch3.sh)** - How Linux Works, chapter 3 I learned the commands for device files, sysfs device path, dd, and device names. In my script I used the dd cammand to write a emapty file. Also, this week where I got to learned how to used [Github](https://github.com/LouVang97/hello-world). Github is a useful tools for development platform inspired by the way you work. From this you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software. Also, this where I would write my scripts.
